Where the Christ would be born.
In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet.
===
I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?
Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.
===
If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.
It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'
===
If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will put his angels in charge of you.' and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you don't dash your foot against a stone.'
You shall not test the Lord, your God.'
===
I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.
Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.'
===
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
don't resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
===
You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.
love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
===
Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.
I want to. Be made clean.
===
Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.
I will come and heal him.
Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof.
===
Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.
The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.
===
Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.
Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.
===
Save us, Lord! We are dying!
Why are you fearful, you of little faith?
===
If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.
Go!
===
Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?
Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
But you go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?
Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
===
If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.
Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well.
===
Have mercy on us, son of David!
Do you believe that I am able to do this?
Yes, Lord.
According to your faith be it done to you.
See that no one knows about this.
===
Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?
Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.
===
This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.
Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
===
Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.
Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?
===
Why do you speak to them in parables?
To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.
===
Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from?
An enemy has done this.
Do you want us to go and gather them up?
No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.
===
Have you understood all these things?
Yes, Lord.
Therefore, every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things.
===
This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.
They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat.
We only have here five loaves and two fish.
Bring them here to me.
===
It's a ghost!
Cheer up! It is I! Don't be afraid.
Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.
Come!
Lord, save me!
You of little faith, why did you doubt?
===
Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread.
Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?
===
Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?
Every plant which my heavenly Father didn't plant will be uprooted. Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.
Explain the parable to us.
Do you also still not understand? Don't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?
===
Send her away; for she cries after us.
I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
===
Lord, help me.
It is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.
Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.
===
I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.
Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?
How many loaves do you have?
Seven, and a few small fish.
===
Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
We brought no bread.
Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, 'because you have brought no bread?'
===
Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?
Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
But who do you say that I am?
You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
===
Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.
Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.
===
Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let's make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.
Get up, and don't be afraid.
===
Don't tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.
Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things, but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn't recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.
===
Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water. So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.
Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.
===
Why weren't we able to cast it out?
Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. But this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting.
===
Doesn't your teacher pay the didrachma?
Yes.
===
What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?
From strangers.
Therefore the children are exempt.
But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin. Take that, and give it to them for me and you.
===
Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?
Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
===
Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?
I don't tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.
===
Pay me what you owe!
Have patience with me, and I will repay you!
You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.
===
Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?
Haven't you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female, for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh? So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don't let man tear apart.
Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her?
Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so. I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery.
If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.
Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given.
===
Allow the little children, and don't forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.
Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
Why do you call me good? No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.
Which ones?
'You shall not murder.' 'You shall not commit adultery.' 'You shall not steal.' 'You shall not offer false testimony.''Honor your father and mother.' And, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?
If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
===
Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.
Who then can be saved?
With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we have?
Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
===
Why do you stand here all day idle?
Because no one has hired us.
You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.
===
Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn't you agree with me for a denarius?
Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you.
Isn't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?
So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.
===
What do you want?
Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.
You don't know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
We are able.
You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father.
===
Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!
What do you want me to do for you?
Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
===
Who is this?
This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.
It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers!
===
Do you hear what these are saying?
Yes. Did you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?'
===
How did the fig tree immediately wither away?
Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don't doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it would be done. All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.
===
By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?
I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
===
We don't know.
Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, 'Son, go work today in my vineyard.'
I will not.
===
Which of the two did the will of his father?
The first.
===
Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter who you teach, for you aren't partial to anyone. Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
Why do you test me, you hypocrites? Show me the tax money.
Whose is this image and inscription?
Caesar's. Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.
===
In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.
You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
===
Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.
===
What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?
Of David.
How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord.
===
Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?
Be careful that no one leads you astray.
===
Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.
What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.
===
Lord, Lord, open to us.
Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you.
===
Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.
Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.
Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.
Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.
Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn't sow, and gather where I didn't scatter.
===
Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn't help you?
Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn't do it to one of the least of these, you didn't do it to me.
===
Why this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
Why do you trouble the woman? Because she has done a good work for me.
===
Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?
Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him.
===
Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.
It isn't me, is it, Lord?
He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.
It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?
You said it.
===
All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.
Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.
Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.
Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.
Sit here, while I go there and pray.
===
Hail, Rabbi!
Friend, why are you here?
===
I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.
You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.
He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. What do you think?
He is worthy of death!
===
You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!
I don't know what you are talking about.
===
This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
I don't know the man.
===
Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.
I don't know the man!
===
I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.
What is that to us? You see to it.
===
Are you the King of the Jews?
So you say.
===
Which of the two do you want me to release to you?
Barabbas!
What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?
Let him be crucified!
Why? What evil has he done?
Let him be crucified!
===
I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.
May his blood be on us, and on our children!
