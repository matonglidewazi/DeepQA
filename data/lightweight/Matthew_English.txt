Where the Christ would be born.
In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet.
===
I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?
Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.
===
If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.
It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'
===
If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will put his angels in charge of you.' and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you don't dash your foot against a stone.'
You shall not test the Lord, your God.'
===
I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.
Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.'
===
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
don't resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
===
You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.
love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
===
Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.
I want to. Be made clean.
===
Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.
I will come and heal him.
Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof.
===
Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.
The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.
===
Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.
Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.
===
Save us, Lord! We are dying!
Why are you fearful, you of little faith?
===
If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.
Go!
===
Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?
Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
But you go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?
Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
===
If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.
Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well.
===
Have mercy on us, son of David!
Do you believe that I am able to do this?
Yes, Lord.
According to your faith be it done to you.
See that no one knows about this.
===
Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?
Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.
===
This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.
Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
===
Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.
Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?
===
Why do you speak to them in parables?
To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.
===
Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from?
An enemy has done this.
Do you want us to go and gather them up?
No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.
===
Have you understood all these things?
Yes, Lord.
Therefore, every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things.
===
This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.
They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat.
We only have here five loaves and two fish.
Bring them here to me.
===
It's a ghost!
Cheer up! It is I! Don't be afraid.
Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.
Come!
Lord, save me!
You of little faith, why did you doubt?
===
Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread.
Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?
===
Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?
Every plant which my heavenly Father didn't plant will be uprooted. Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.
Explain the parable to us.
Do you also still not understand? Don't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?
===
Send her away; for she cries after us.
I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
===
Lord, help me.
It is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.
Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.
===
I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.
Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?
How many loaves do you have?
Seven, and a few small fish.
===
Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
We brought no bread.
Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, 'because you have brought no bread?'
===
Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?
Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
But who do you say that I am?
You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
===
Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.
Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.
===
Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let's make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.
Get up, and don't be afraid.
===
Don't tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.
Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things, but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn't recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.
===
Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water. So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.
Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.
===
Why weren't we able to cast it out?
Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. But this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting.
===
Doesn't your teacher pay the didrachma?
Yes.
===
What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?
From strangers.
Therefore the children are exempt.
But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin. Take that, and give it to them for me and you.
===
Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?
Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
===
Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?
I don't tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.
===
Pay me what you owe!
Have patience with me, and I will repay you!
You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.
===
Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?
Haven't you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female, for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh? So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don't let man tear apart.
Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her?
Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so. I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery.
If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.
Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given.
===
Allow the little children, and don't forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.
Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
Why do you call me good? No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.
Which ones?
'You shall not murder.' 'You shall not commit adultery.' 'You shall not steal.' 'You shall not offer false testimony.''Honor your father and mother.' And, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?
If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
===
Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.
Who then can be saved?
With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we have?
Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
===
Why do you stand here all day idle?
Because no one has hired us.
You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.
===
Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn't you agree with me for a denarius?
Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you.
Isn't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?
So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.
===
What do you want?
Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.
You don't know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
We are able.
You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father.
===
Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!
What do you want me to do for you?
Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
===
Who is this?
This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.
It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers!
===
Do you hear what these are saying?
Yes. Did you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?'
===
How did the fig tree immediately wither away?
Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don't doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it would be done. All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.
===
By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?
I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
===
We don't know.
Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, 'Son, go work today in my vineyard.'
I will not.
===
Which of the two did the will of his father?
The first.
===
Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter who you teach, for you aren't partial to anyone. Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
Why do you test me, you hypocrites? Show me the tax money.
Whose is this image and inscription?
Caesar's. Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.
===
In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.
You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
===
Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.
===
What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?
Of David.
How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord.
===
Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?
Be careful that no one leads you astray.
===
Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.
What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.
===
Lord, Lord, open to us.
Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you.
===
Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.
Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.
Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.
Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.
Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn't sow, and gather where I didn't scatter.
===
Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn't help you?
Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn't do it to one of the least of these, you didn't do it to me.
===
Why this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
Why do you trouble the woman? Because she has done a good work for me.
===
Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?
Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him.
===
Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.
It isn't me, is it, Lord?
He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.
It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?
You said it.
===
All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.
Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.
Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.
Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.
Sit here, while I go there and pray.
===
Hail, Rabbi!
Friend, why are you here?
===
I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.
You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.
He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. What do you think?
He is worthy of death!
===
You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!
I don't know what you are talking about.
===
This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
I don't know the man.
===
Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.
I don't know the man!
===
I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.
What is that to us? You see to it.
===
Are you the King of the Jews?
So you say.
===
Which of the two do you want me to release to you?
Barabbas!
What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?
Let him be crucified!
Why? What evil has he done?
Let him be crucified!
===
I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.
May his blood be on us, and on our children!
===
Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!
Be quiet, and come out of him!
===
If you want to, you can make me clean.
I want to. Be made clean.
===
I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.
We never saw anything like this!
===
Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?
Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
===
Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?
Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can't fast.
===
Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?
Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry; he, and those who were with him? 
The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
Stand up. Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?
===
He has Beelzebul, By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.
How can Satan cast out Satan?
If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end.
But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.
Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;
but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin
===
He has an unclean spirit.
Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you.
Who are my mother and my brothers?
Behold, my mother and my brothers!
For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
===
Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow, and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.
Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.
When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.
Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.
When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables, that 'seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.
Don't you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?
The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.
These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.
They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.
Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word, and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.
Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn't it put on a stand?
For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.
If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.
Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.
For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.
The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth, and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn't know how.
For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.
How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?
It's like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.
===
Let's go over to the other side.
Teacher, don't you care that we are dying?
Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?
Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
===
What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don't torment me.
Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!
Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.
===
My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live. If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.
Who touched my clothes?
You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'
Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.
Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?
Don't be afraid, only believe.
===
Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.
Girl, I tell you, get up!
Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?
Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?
A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.
===
Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.
Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!
===
John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.
He is Elijah.
He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.
This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead.
It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.
===
Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.
Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.
What shall I ask?
The head of John the Baptizer.
I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.
===
You come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile.
This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.
Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.
You give them something to eat.
Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?
How many loaves do you have? Go see.
Five, and two fish.
===
Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.
Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.
Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;
Hear me, all of you, and understand.
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!
===
Are you thus without understanding also? Don't you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can't defile him, because it doesn't go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?
That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts.
covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.
All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
===
Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.
Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.
For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.
===
Be opened!
He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!
I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.
If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way.
From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?
How many loaves do you have?
Seven.
===
Why does this generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.
Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.
It's because we have no bread.
Why do you reason that it's because you have no bread? Don't you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened?
Having eyes, don't you see? Having ears, don't you hear? Don't you remember?
When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?
Twelve.
When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?
Seven.
Don't you understand, yet?
===
I see men; for I see them like trees walking.
Don't enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village.
Who do men say that I am?
John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others: one of the prophets.
But who do you say that I am? You are the Christ.
===
Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.
Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
===
Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power.
Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let's make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.
===
Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?
But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him.
===
What are you asking them?
Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit; and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren't able.
Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.
How long has it been since this has come to him?
From childhood. Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.
If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.
I believe. Help my unbelief!
You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!
He is dead.
Why couldn't we cast it out?
This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.
===
The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again.
What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?
If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.
Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, doesn't receive me, but him who sent me.
Teacher, we saw someone who doesn't follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn't follow us.
Don't forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.
For whoever is not against us is on our side.
For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Christ's, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.
Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if he was thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.
If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire, where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.
If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire that will never be quenched.
where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.
If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire,
where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.
For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.
Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.

Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?
What did Moses command you?
Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her.
For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.
But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.
For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,
and the two will become one flesh, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.
What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.
Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her.
If a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery.
===
Allow the little children to come to me! Don't forbid them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
Most certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.
Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
Why do you call me good? No one is good except one: God.
You know the commandments: 'Do not murder,' 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not give false testimony,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and mother.'
===
One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.
How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!
Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!
It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. 
With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.
Behold, we have left all, and have followed you.
Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,
but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life."
Mark 10:31,But many who are first will be last; and the last first.
They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.
Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.
They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.

Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask.
What do you want me to do for you?
Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory.
You don't know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
We are able.
You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;
but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared.
===
You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
But it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.
Whoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bondservant of all.
For the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.
===
Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!
Call him.
Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you!
What do you want me to do for you?
Rabboni, that I may see again.
Go your way. Your faith has made you well.
Go your way into the village that is opposite you. Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring him.
If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs him;' and immediately he will send him back here.
What are you doing, untying the young donkey?
===
Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
===
May no one ever eat fruit from you again!
Isn't it written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?' But you have made it a den of robbers!
Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away.
Have faith in God.
For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and doesn't doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening; he shall have whatever he says.
Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them.
Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions.
But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions.
===
By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?
I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
The baptism of John;was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.
If we should say, 'From heaven;' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
If we should say, 'From men'; they feared the people, for all held John to really be a prophet.
We don't know.
Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country.
When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard.
They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty.
Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.
Again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some.
Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.
But those farmers said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.
Haven't you even read this Scripture: 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner.
This was from the Lord, it is marvelous in our eyes'?
===
Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don't defer to anyone; for you aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
Shall we give, or shall we not give?
Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.
Whose is this image and inscription?
Caesar's.
Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.

Teacher, Moses wrote to us, 'If a man's brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.
There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring.
The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;
and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.
In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.
Isn't this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?
For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
But about the dead, that they are raised; haven't you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.
