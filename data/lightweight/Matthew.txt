If Son thou art of God; cast thyself down, for it hath been written, that, His messengers He shall charge concerning thee, and on hands they shall bear thee up, that thou mayest not dash on a stone thy foot.
It hath been written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
===
All these to thee I will give, if falling down thou mayest bow to me.
Adversary, for it hath been written, The Lord thy God thou shalt bow to, and Him only thou shalt serve.
===
Sir, if thou art willing, thou art able to cleanse me.
I will, be thou cleansed,' and immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
===
Sir, my young man hath been laid in the house a paralytic, fearfully afflicted.
I, having come, will heal him.
===
Sir, I am not worthy that thou mayest enter under my roof, but only say a word, and my servant shall be healed.
Verily I say to you, not even in Israel so great faith have I found.
===
Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou mayest go.
The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man hath not where he may lay the head.
===
Sir, permit me first to depart and to bury my father.
Follow me, and suffer the dead to bury their own dead.
===
Sir, save us; we are perishing.
Why are ye fearful, ye of little faith?
===
To us and to thee, Jesus, Son of God? didst thou come hither, before the time, to afflict us.
Go.
===
This one doth speak evil.
Why think ye evil in your hearts?
===
Wherefore with the tax-gatherers and sinners doth your teacher eat?
They who are whole have no need of a physician, but they who are ill;
===
Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much, and thy disciples fast not?
Can the sons of the bride-chamber mourn, so long as the bridegroom is with them? but days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them, and then they shall fast.
Deal kindly with us, Son of David.
===
Believe ye that I am able to do this?
Yes, sir.
===
According to your faith let it be to you see, let no one know;
If only I may touch his garment, I shall be saved.
===
Art thou He who is coming, or for another do we look?
To the land of Sodom it shall be more tolerable in a day of judgment than to thee.
===
I do confess to Thee, Father, Lord of the heavens and of the earth, that thou didst hide these things from wise and understanding ones, and didst reveal them to babes.
Lo, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on a sabbath.
===
Did ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, himself and those with him?
What man shall be of you, who shall have one sheep, and if this may fall on the sabbaths into a ditch, will not lay hold on it and raise it?
===
Stretch forth thy hand.
Is this the Son of David?
Every kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated, and no city or house having been divided against itself, doth stand.
===
Teacher, we will to see a sign from thee.
A generation, evil and adulterous, doth seek a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet;
===
Lo, thy mother and thy brethren do stand without, seeking to speak to thee.
Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
Lo, my mother and my brethren!
For whoever may do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
===
Wherefore in similes dost thou speak to them?
To you it hath been given to know the secrets of the reign of the heavens, and to these it hath not been given.
===
Sir, good seed didst thou not sow in thy field? whence then hath it the darnel?
No, lest; gathering up the darnel; ye root up with it the wheat,
===
Explain to us the simile of the darnel of the field.
He who is sowing the good seed is the Son of Man.
===
Did ye understand all these?
Yes, sir.
===
Because of this every scribe having been discipled in regard to the reign of the heavens, is like to a man, a householder, who doth bring forth out of his treasure things new and old.
Whence to this one this wisdom and the mighty works?
A prophet is not without honour except in his own country, and in his own house.
===
They have no need to go away; give ye them to eat.
We have not here except five loaves, and two fishes.
===
Be of good courage, I am he, be not afraid.
Sir, if it is thou, bid me come to thee upon the waters;
Come.
Sir, save me.
Little faith! for what didst thou waver?
Truly; God's Son art thou.
===
Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they may eat bread.
Wherefore also do ye transgress the command of God because of your tradition?
===
Hear and understand: not that which is coming into the mouth doth defile the man, but that which is coming forth from the mouth, this defileth the man.
Hast thou known that the Pharisees, having heard the word, were stumbled?
===
Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant shall be rooted up;
Explain to us this simile.
Are ye also yet without understanding?
===
I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Sir, help me;
It is not good to take the children's bread, and to cast to the little dogs.
Yes, sir, for even the little dogs do eat of the crumbs that are falling from their lords' table;
O woman, great is thy faith, let it be to thee as thou wilt;
===
I have compassion upon the multitude, because now three days they continue with me, and they have not what they may eat; and to let them away fasting I will not, lest they faint in the way.
Whence to us, in a wilderness, so many loaves, as to fill so great a multitude?
How many loaves have ye?
Seven, and a few little fishes.
Evening having come, ye say, Fair weather, for the heaven is red.
===
Beware, and take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees;
Because we took no loaves.
Why reason ye in yourselves, ye of little faith, because ye took no loaves?
===
Who do men say me to be; the Son of Man?
Some, John the Baptist, and others, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
===
And ye; who do ye say me to be?
Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
===
Happy art thou, Simon Bar-Jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.
Be kind to thyself, sir; this shall not be to thee;
Get thee behind me, adversary! thou art a stumbling-block to me, for thou dost not mind the things of God, but the things of men.
===
If any one doth will to come after me, let him disown himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Sir, it is good to us to be here; if thou wilt, we may make here three booths &#8212; for thee one, and for Moses one, and one for Elijah.
Rise, be not afraid.
===
Say to no one the vision, till the Son of Man out of the dead may rise.
Sir, deal kindly with my son, for he is lunatic, and doth suffer miserably, for often he doth fall into the fire, and often into the water.
O generation, unstedfast and perverse, till when shall I be with you? till when shall I bear you? bring him to me hither;
Wherefore were we not able to cast him out?
Through your want of faith; for verily I say to you, if ye may have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this mount, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible to you.
===
The Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of men.
Your teacher; doth he not pay the didrachms?
Yes.
From the strangers.
Then are the sons free;
Who, now, is greater in the reign of the heavens?
Verily I say to you, if ye may not be turned and become as the children, ye may not enter into the reign of the heavens;
Sir, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him; till seven times?
I do not say to thee till seven times, but till seventy times seven.
Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
Did ye not read, that He who made them, from the beginning a male and a female made them.
===
Moses for your stiffness of heart did suffer you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it hath not been so.
If the case of the man with the woman is so, it is not good to marry.
All do not receive this word, but those to whom it hath been given;
===
Suffer the children, and forbid them not, to come unto me, for of such is the reign of the heavens;
Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have life age-during?
Why me dost thou call good? no one is good except One: God; but if thou dost will to enter into the life, keep the commands.
What kind?
Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness.
All these did I keep from my youth; what yet do I lack?
If thou dost will to be perfect, go away, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me.
===
Verily I say to you, that hardly shall a rich man enter into the reign of the heavens and again I say to you, it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to go, than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God.
Who, then, is able to be saved?
With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
Lo, we did leave all, and follow thee, what then shall we have?
Verily I say to you, that ye who did follow me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man may sit upon a throne of his glory, shall sit; ye also; upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel;
Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes.
What wilt thou?
Say, that they may sit; these my two sons; one on thy right hand, and one on the left, in thy reign.
Ye have not known what ye ask for yourselves; are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about to drink? and with the baptism that I am baptized with, to be baptized?
We are able.
Of my cup indeed ye shall drink, and with the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be baptized; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but; to those for whom it hath been prepared by my father.
===
Ye have known that the rulers of the nations do exercise lordship over them, and those great do exercise authority over them.
Deal kindly with us, sir; Son of David.
What will ye that I may do to you?
Sir, that our eyes may be opened;
Go on to the village over-against you, and immediately ye shall find an ass bound, and a colt with her; having loosed, bring ye to me;
Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Lo, thy king doth come to thee, meek, and mounted on an ass, and a colt, a foal of a beast of burden.
===
Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
Who is this?
This is Jesus the prophet, who is from Nazareth of Galilee.
It hath been written, My house a house of prayer shall be called, but ye did make it a den of robbers.
Hearest thou what these say?
Yes, did ye never read, that, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou didst prepare praise?
===
No more from thee may fruit be; to the age;
How did the fig-tree forthwith wither?
Verily I say to you, If ye may have faith, and may not doubt, not only this of the fig-tree shall ye do, but even if to this mount ye may say, Be lifted up and be cast into the sea, it shall come to pass;
By what authority dost thou do these things? and who gave thee this authority?
I will ask you; I also; one word, which if ye may tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things;
We have not known.
Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
And what think ye? A man had two children, and having come to the first, he said, Child, go, to-day be working in my vineyard.
I will not.
===
Which of the two did the will of the father?
The first.
Verily I say to you, that the tax-gatherers and the harlots do go before you into the reign of God.
Evil men; he will evilly destroy them, and the vineyard will give out to other husbandmen, who will give back to him the fruits in their seasons.
Did ye never read in the Writings, A stone that the builders disallowed, it became head of a corner; from the Lord hath this come to pass, and it is wonderful in our eyes.
===
Whose is this image and the inscription?
Caesar's;
Render therefore the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;
If any one may die not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and shall raise up seed to his brother.
Ye go astray, not knowing the Writings, nor the power of God;
Teacher, which is the great command in the Law?'
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine understanding.
What do ye think concerning the Christ? of whom is he son?
How then doth David in the Spirit call him lord, saying.
===
Do ye not see all these? verily I say to you, There may not be left here a stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down.
Tell us, when shall these be? and what is the sign of thy presence, and of the full end of the age?
Take heed that no one may lead you astray, for many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and they shall lead many astray.
Sir, sir, open to us;
Verily I say to you, I have not known you.
Watch therefore, for ye have not known the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man doth come.
Why do ye give trouble to the woman? for a good work she wrought for me;
What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him up to you?' and they weighed out to him thirty silverlings.
Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.
Is it I, Sir?
He who did dip with me the hand in the dish, he will deliver me up
Is it I, Rabbi?
Thou hast said.
===
Take, eat, this is my body;
Even if all shall be stumbled at thee, I will never be stumbled.
Verily I say to thee, that, this night, before cock-crowing, thrice thou wilt deny me.
Even if it may be necessary for me to die with thee, I will not deny thee;' in like manner also said all the disciples.
Sit ye here, till having gone away, I shall pray yonder.
===
Sleep on henceforth, and rest! lo, the hour hath come nigh, and the Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of sinners.
I adjure thee, by the living God, that thou mayest say to us, if thou art the Christ; the Son of God.
Thou hast said; nevertheless I say to you, hereafter ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power, and coming upon the clouds, of the heaven.
Art thou the king of the Jews!
Thou sayest.
